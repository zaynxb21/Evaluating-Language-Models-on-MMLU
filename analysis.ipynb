    "- You are allowed to use any built-in Python library that comes with Anaconda. If you want to use an external library, you may do so, but must justify your choice.\n",
    "- Make sure you use the data folder provided in the repository in read-only mode. (Or alternatively, be sure you don’t change any of the files.)\n",
    "- Be sure to provide a concise textual description of your thought process, the assumptions you made, the solution you implemented, and explanations for your answers. A notebook that only has code cells will not suffice. To avoid confusion: use short comments for longer code answers.\n",
    "- For questions containing the /Discuss:/ prefix, answer not with code, but with a textual explanation (in markdown).\n",
    "- Back up any hypotheses and claims with data, since this is an important aspect of the course.\n",
    "- Please write all your comments in English, and use meaningful variable names in your code. Your repo should have a single notebook (plus the required data files) in the master/main branch. If there are multiple notebooks present, we will not grade anything.\n",
    "- We will not run your notebook for you! Rather, we will grade it as is, which means that only the results contained in your evaluated code cells will be considered, and we will not see the results in unevaluated code cells. Thus, be sure to hand in a fully-run and evaluated notebook. In order to check whether everything looks as intended, you can check the rendered notebook on the GitHub website once you have pushed your solution there.\n",
    "- In continuation to the previous point, interactive plots, such as those generated using the ‘plotly’ package, should be strictly avoided! Make sure to print results and/or dataframes that confirm you have properly addressed the task.\n",

    "AI is booming! Newspapers, influencers, and your relatives all agree that AI is important. But while almost everyone agrees that AI is the future, much is unclear about what that future looks like…\n",
    "\n",
    "Freshly graduated from the EPFL, you are hired by the Swiss government to advise on a large-scale “AI integration” initiative code-named **\"NEUTRALITY\"** (Navigating Efficient Upgrades Through Robust Artificial Learning Integration Techniques Yearly). Convinced by the stunning progress in language modeling, the government would like to battle the growing shortages in the education sector by using LMs. Your job description: investigate which LMs might be best suited!\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given the results of three LMs on the [“Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300) dataset to compare. This famous dataset consists of 57 subjects with multiple-choice questions, covering diverse subjects like mathematics, computer science, history, and law. Most providers of state-of-the-art LMs use this dataset to showcase the versatility of their latest models. Unfortunately, Horta-Ribeiro, the intern responsible for collecting the results, didn’t take EPFL’s famous ADA course. As a result, the collected datasets are slightly corrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A very brief primer on Language Models\n",
    "Language models (LMs) are sophisticated statistical models designed to understand and generate human-like text. At their core, LMs are trained to predict the most likely continuation of a given input text. For example, given the input \"The cat sat on the,\" an LM might predict \"mat\" as a likely continuation.\n",
    "LMs are trained on vast text samples from various sources, including books, websites, and social media. This extensive training allows them to capture patterns and relationships in language, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text across a wide range of topics and styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "While LMs can produce text that appears to be written by intelligent humans, it's important to note that their capabilities can diverge from human intelligence in unexpected ways. They may sometimes generate factually incorrect information or struggle with complex reasoning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two key concepts in understanding LMs are:\n",
    "1. **Tokens**: LMs process text using \"tokens\" rather than individual characters. Tokens can be words, parts of words, or punctuation marks. For example, the sentence \"I love AI!\" might be tokenized as [\"I\", \"love\", \"AI\", \"!\"]. Tokenization is the first step in both training and using an LM.\n",
    "2. **Context**: The input text provided to an LM is called the \"context.\" This context informs the model's predictions or generations. A longer or more specific context often leads to more accurate and relevant outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "[See: Wikipedia entry on language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)\n",

    "###  Files for this assignment\n",
    "This assignment is divided into three tasks, each of which should bring you a step closer to providing a recommendation toward project NEUTRALITY’s objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task 1**: Inspecting the results and getting your first model ranking\n",
    "- **Task 2**: Inspecting the underlying data used to generate the results for possible biases\n",
    "- **Task 3**: Learning about tokens and providing a final recommendation\n",

In fact, higher data loss in df_z suggests that it produced more invalid (or non-standard) responses which could affect the assessment of its true performance relative to df_x and df_y!

For the subjects that are in common to two model groupings, we take the minimum of the counts among count_x, count_y and count_z, then make all counts for that specific subject to this minimum value by randomly removing samples. For example if count_x = 15, count_y = 20, and count_z = 22, we randomly remove answers of the specific subject from df_y_joint and df_z_joint such that count_x = count_y = count_z = 15.

LM X does worse on MMLU than on Other going from 74.36% to 78.80% (a noticeable difference of 4.44%), LM Y does better on MMLU than on Other going from 76.15% to 72.09% (a noticeable difference of 4.06%), but LM Z was less likely to changes going from 65.60% in MMLU to 67.17% in Other (a difference of 1.57% only), always underperfroming LM X and LM Y. This reinforces the hypothesis that the distribution of correct answers A, B, C and D does depend on the dataset here. The standard errors are obviously larger for the Other dataset than the MMLU dataset, as the latter is much larger, we can explain that by the formula of the standard error in which we divide the standard deviation by the square-root of the datasets size."

So we can see that LM X frequently predicts \"A\" but has low accuracy when doing so it may have a bias towards \"A\", leading to over-prediction without corresponding accuracy. We see the same pattern for LM Y towards predicting \"D\", LM Y seems biased towards \"D\", sacrificing accuracy for frequency. Finaly, for LM Z, the distribution of answers is relatively balanced but we can see that there's something special in \"A\", its is predicted the least likely (18.60%) and with only 47.61% accuracy (the lowest too), so the model is eventually finding difficulty in correctly identifying when option A is the correct answer. In fact, for the answers distribution we have that D > C > B > A and for the accuracy conditonned on the given answer we have also that D > C > B > A, so the model seems in general to perform less better going from \"D\" to \"A\". In general, for all models, more the result letter predicted is frequent the less accurate it is."

    "Based on the analysis from tasks 1, 2, and 3, here is my final recommendation to the government on the use of LMs in education:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inconsistent answer formats: We observed that LMs do not always provide answers in the desired format. They can include explanation and clarification of their reasoning, or use different formats for the same amount of information (like \"Answer: A\" instead of just \"A\"). This inconsistency can lead to high difficulties and inaccuracies in automatic grading and may affect the reliability of assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Address potential positional biases: The LMs could rely also on the position of the correct answer rather than only understanding the content. When we shuffled the positions of correct answers, all models showed significant drops in performance. This suggests that models may be using heuristics based on answer positions instead of fully understanding the questions, and this could lead to unfair assessments. It's important to address this bias to ensure that models make decisions based on comprehension rather than position.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mitigate bias influencing answer choices: Certain LMs show biases towards specific answer options, possibly due to token imbalances in the data. For example, LM X frequently predicts \"A\" but has low accuracy when doing so, while achieving high accuracy when predicting \"C\" or \"D\" despite predicting them less often. Similarly, LM Y seems biased towards \"D\", predicting it frequently but with lower accuracy compared to other options. We also observed a clear dominance of the token for \"A\" across both questions and answers, which could bias models towards favoring options labeled as \"A\". Balancing the token distribution and addressing these biases is essential to prevent models from being unfairly influenced.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Manage context length limitations for cheaper LMs: We saw that some subjects have a significant number of question-answer pairs exceeding the turbo model's 300-token context limit, especially in high school history subjects. For these cases, relying solely on the turbo model could lead to incomplete processing of information. The government could consider using other models for longer inputs or apply preprocessing techniques to rewrite the problematic question-answer pairs more concisely without altering their meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other interesting point : \n",
    "\n",
    "0. Ensure fairness in model evaluations: Significant differences in the number of questions answered by each model across subjects can lead to biased evaluations. To address this, it is necessary to implement data balancing techniques like undersampling to equalize the number of questions per subject for each model, or (more strictly) evaluate all models on a common set of questions. This will ensure fairer performance comparisons."
